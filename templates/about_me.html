          About Me
        </h3>
        <p style="text-align:justify">
          Hi, I'm Vannsh Jagtiani, a student of 11-S at The Shri Ram School, Moulsari. I am a curious and passionate
          learner with a love for problem-solving and an innate desire to make a difference in the world. As someone
          with strong academic capabilities and a knack for public speaking, I’ve participated and won awards in several
          Model United Nations (MUNs) and debate competitions. However, my true passion lies in bridging communication
          gaps for individuals who face challenges in expressing themselves, especially those who are neurodivergent or
          struggle with speech and hearing disabilities.
          Previously, I created Awaaz Mitr, an app that helps neurodivergent students learn Hindi, inspired by the
          struggles I witnessed in those around me. Now, I am working on my latest innovation: a website powered by a
          Language Learning Model (LLM) to aid public speakers in refining their speeches by integrating emotions and
          expression into their content.

        <h3>
          What Problem Does This Website Solve?
        </h3>
        <p style="text-align:justify">
          Public speaking is more than just delivering words—it is about conveying emotion, passion, and authenticity.
          Many speakers, whether beginners or experienced, find it difficult to imbue their speeches with the right
          tone, emotional depth, and expressions that connect with their audience. Often, they struggle to assess how
          their content is perceived emotionally, which can make even a well-written speech feel flat or disconnected.
          This website solves that problem. By uploading your speech and selecting an emotional toggle, the app uses
          advanced LLM technology to analyze your content and provide feedback on how to enhance it with the appropriate
          emotions. Whether you're trying to inspire, persuade, or connect emotionally with your audience, the app gives
          you suggestions on the tone and writing style adjustments to help you deliver a powerful and memorable speech.

          My Motivation
        </h3>
        <p style="text-align:justify">
          Seeing individuals, especially neurodivergent students, face challenges in communication deeply moved me. I
          realized that the ability to communicate effectively is a privilege, and I wanted to extend that to more
          people.
          I began with Awaaz Mitr, a project close to my heart, and it motivated me to further explore how technology
          could assist in enhancing communication in different ways.
          As a public speaker myself, I know firsthand how critical it is to connect emotionally with your audience. I
          created this LLM-powered website to provide an accessible tool for public speakers of all kinds to master
          not
          just the content of their speeches but also the emotional impact they have on their listeners. This project
          is
          my way of ensuring that everyone can speak not just with words, but with emotions that truly resonate.
